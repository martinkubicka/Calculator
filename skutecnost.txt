On our first meeting we thought that there are't that much problems. It means that over time we found out that there are hidden problems. So whole project take much more time than we thought. We met only few deadlines. Sometimes happened that we changed our roles, so we changed a plan lot of times. Last problem was communication which we should improve and everyone of us should be more active.
